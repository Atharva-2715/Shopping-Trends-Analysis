This project is mainly based on analyzing the shopping trends of the customers in different aspects and situations. The primary objective of this project was to take raw data and identify the key trends which will help in enhancing the customer satisfaction and improve the revenue.
In this project I had to identify shopping trends using data analysis for identification of unique and repetitive patterns of shopping of customers. This will in fact help in increasing the revenue and improving the customer experience.
The methodology involves the development of a Python script which uses different libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn. This script offers several functionalities which include sales tracking, customer segmentation and product insights. And this script was divided into several functions which had unique operations to be performed. This is a menu driven script which was done to make it more user-friendly to access these analyses.
The primary analysis from this project were the purchasing behavior of the customer, popular products, average spending of the consumers, and customer preferences. This insight helps to develop targeted marketing and increase the revenue.
In conclusion, this project demonstrates how Python based tools can efficiently analyze the given data and can give the results we desire and which can help us in decision making and operating efficiently.
